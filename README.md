# SVM_Gaussian

General Information
-------------------

This repository contains the R version and Python version of the SVM function from scratch. The SVM function constructed here only contains the linear SVM without the bias term and the SVM with the Gaussian Kernel. The opitmization algorithm here used is the Coordinate Ascent.

Mathmetica Background
---------------------

The SVM with L2 norm regularization has the loss function based on the hinge loss that
